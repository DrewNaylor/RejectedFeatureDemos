# RejectedFeatureDemos
Features that I wrote for various applications and ended up scrapping, but still had enough potential value to end up here.

These feature demos are basically stubs and just enough of the original application to show the feature of interest, but nothing else.

Each feature demo will have its license in its own folder, though I intend on putting them under the MIT License to make reusing them elsewhere easier. As a result, this repo will be set to the MIT License but anything with its own license will be specified as such.

The demos that will be here include UXL Launcher's logging and LaunchDotDesktop's file list editor window. See also https://github.com/DrewNaylor/RejectedFeatureDemos/issues/1
